Easy to understand statistics in a javascript site.

## Statistics

TODO:
    Confidence Intervals.

## Development

Initially based on the Angular.js seed project.

## Implemented Ideas

## To Implement

Find the distribution.

### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files

### Directory Layout

    app/                --> all of the files to be used in production
      css/              --> css files
        app.css         --> default stylesheet
      img/              --> image files
      index.html        --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
      index-async.html  --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
      js/               --> javascript files
        app.js          --> application
        controllers.js  --> application controllers
        directives.js   --> application directives
        filters.js      --> custom angular filters
        services.js     --> custom angular services
      lib/              --> angular and 3rd party javascript libraries
        angular/
          angular.js        --> the latest angular js
          angular.min.js    --> the latest minified angular js
          angular-*.js      --> angular add-on modules
          version.txt       --> version number
      partials/             --> angular view partials (partial html templates)
        partial1.html
        partial2.html

    config/karma.conf.js        --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
    config/karma-e2e.conf.js    --> config file for running e2e tests with Karma

    scripts/            --> handy shell/js/ruby scripts
      e2e-test.sh       --> runs end-to-end tests with Karma (*nix)
      e2e-test.bat      --> runs end-to-end tests with Karma (windows)
      test.bat          --> autotests unit tests with Karma (windows)
      test.sh           --> autotests unit tests with Karma (*nix)
      web-server.js     --> simple development webserver based on node.js

    test/               --> test source files and libraries
      e2e/              -->
        runner.html     --> end-to-end test runner (open in your browser to run)
        scenarios.js    --> end-to-end specs
      lib/
        angular/                --> angular testing libraries
          angular-mocks.js      --> mocks that replace certain angular services in tests
          angular-scenario.js   --> angular's scenario (end-to-end) test runner library
          version.txt           --> version file
      unit/                     --> unit level specs/tests
        controllersSpec.js      --> specs for controllers
        directivessSpec.js      --> specs for directives
        filtersSpec.js          --> specs for filters
        servicesSpec.js         --> specs for services
